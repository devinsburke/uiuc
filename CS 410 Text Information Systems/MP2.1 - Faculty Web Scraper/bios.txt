Todd Nelson Assistant Professor of Engineering Engineering Department Email 812-464-1874 Business and Engineering Center - 2029 Email: tgnelson@usi.edu Biography: Todd G Nelson is an Assistant Professor of Engineering at the University of Southern Indiana (USI). Dr. Nelson received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Brigham Young University (BYU). Prior to joining USI in 2018 he was an adjunct faculty member at BYU and guest researcher at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Dr. Nelson's research focuses on origami-inspired mechanisms and compliant mechanisms. He enjoys exploring the crossover between the ancient art of origami and engineering. This combination has led to novel mechanisms and products which can be ultra-compact, deployable, scalable, and fabricated from a single sheet of material. His research has diverse applications including medical implants, surgical tools, aerospace applications, automotive airbags, and deployable structures. He enjoys teaching mechanism and machine design courses, introducing students to the product design process, and exploring how math, engineering, nature, and art can be integrated to create innovative design.
